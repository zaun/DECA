# **Project:** DECA
## Something new to try

I got myself a DECA for Christmas 2017. I'm an avid programmer, I know several leanguages, and it's been my professional career for the last 25 years or so. I wanted to try something new so I'm delving into the world of FPGAs.

#### Tools

I'm on a Apple Mac. I know, I'm probably asking for a world of hurt but I'm attempting to do as much as I can without a VM.

* [Brew](https://brew.sh/) - Get it, love it. On a Mac, there is no better way to install all the apps
* [icarus-verilog](http://brewformulas.org/IcarusVerilog) - I haven't used this directly yet, but its required for other things to work
* [verilator](http://brewformulas.org/verilator) - Simulation framework used for testing and debugging

I use [Atom](https://atom.io/) as my editor. It is more than enough for my needs. I use the following packages for Atom:

* [language-verilog](https://atom.io/packages/language-verilog) - Syntax highlighting for Verilog and SystemVerilog
* [linter-verilog](https://atom.io/packages/linter-verilog) - A linter for Verilog and SystemVerilog
* [language-make](https://atom.io/packages/language-make) - Syntax highlighting for Makefiles

#### Projects
